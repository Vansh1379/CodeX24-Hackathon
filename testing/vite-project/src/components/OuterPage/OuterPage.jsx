                <div className="description"><p>Robinhood has become the latest company to receive a crypto-related Wells notice from the Securities and Exchange Commission.

                    If you don t know what a Wells notice is, you might be new to crypto. The notice is basically a heads-up given to a company that the SEC completed an investigation and may pursue an enforcement action against them.

                    The notice doesn t always mean that legal action will play out, but this is crypto.
                    <br />
                    <br />

                    This time last year, for example, we were playing the waiting game after Coinbase was served with a Wells notice in March. The SEC then filed a suit against the exchange company in June.

                    As I previously reported, if that timeline holds, we could be looking at a summer legal action — similar to what we saw with Coinbase.

                    So if things head to court, what happens exactly?
                    <br /><br />

                    Robinhood, as part of its disclosures, said the SEC alleged that it violated 15(a) and 17A of the Securities Exchange Act. If that rings a bell, it s because both Coinbase and Binance were hit with similar charges.

                    17A focuses on clearing agencies and 15(a) centers around broker-dealer registration. It s unclear if the SEC will seek charges regarding tokens it believes are securities, like we ve seen in other cases.

                    For its part, Robinhood has tried to stay out of the SEC s spotlight by delisting tokens that the regulatory agency has targeted, such as Solana s SOL, Polygon s MATIC, and Cardano s ADA. Unfortunately, it doesn t seem like any company offering crypto services can avoid Gensler s ire.

                    The potential action may involve a civil injunctive action, public administrative proceeding, and/or a cease-and-desist proceeding,” Robinhood warned in its disclosure.

                    Putting aside the potential charges, let s talk about Robinhood s chief legal and compliance officer, Dan Gallagher.
                    <br />
                    <br />

                    Gallagher is actually no stranger to the SEC, having served as a Commissioner between 2011 to 2015. He worked in other positions within the SEC as well.

                    Gallagher said yesterday that he was “disappointed” and insisted that the “assets listed on our platform are not securities.” He called the case against Robinhood Crypto “weak.” Perhaps Gensler s met his match?

                    Either way, Robinhood s not alone in the SEC s spotlight.
                    <br /><br />

                    Though Consensys — another company that was served with a Wells notice — may face different charges in a potential lawsuit from the regulator. We know from the lawsuit Consensys filed against the SEC that its Wells notice centered on two of its product offerings: MetaMask Swaps and MetaMask Staking.

                    One aspect could look similar, however.
                    <br /><br />

                    Consensys said the SEC held a telephone conference between the two parties during which SEC staffers said they believed the Brooklyn-based company was operating as an unregistered broker-dealer because of the MetaMask Swaps software.

                    The SEC also took issue with the staking program — which would echo what we ve seen in the Coinbase and Binance cases. Consensys violated the Securities Act, the SEC allegedly said, because it offered and sold unregistered securities.

                    The third company in our roundup, Uniswap, represents the most unknowns so far. While Uniswap disclosed its Wells notice, it didn t disclose any specifics. Uniswap didn t respond to a request for comment on the details, either.

                    As our own Casey Wagner pointed out in this newsletter a few weeks ago, Uniswap chief legal officer Marvin Ammori said securities regulators could — as they did with Binance and Coinbase — charge the firm with operating as an unregistered exchange and broker.

                    It seems likely that Uniswap could also face securities charges as well, based on what we ve seen with pending lawsuits and the other Wells notices.

                    So the summer of fun, with the bull market looking like it s just getting started, might be interrupted by a few more lawsuits. Yay.</p></div>
